title: Two ints and a Float.
---
bq. Two ints and a Float are in a bar. They spot an attractive Double on her own. The first int walks up to her. 'Hey, baby', he says, 'my VM or yours?'. She slaps him and he walks back dejected. The second int walks over. 'Hey, cute-stuff, can I cook your Beans for breakfast?'. After a quick slapping, he too walks back. The Float then ambles over casually. 'Were those two primitive types bothering you?', he remarks. 'Yes. I'm so glad you're here', she says. 'They just had no Class!'

Vind ik persoonlijk wel een goeike. :D
