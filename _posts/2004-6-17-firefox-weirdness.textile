title: Firefox weirdness
---
Strange things happened with my <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox 0.9</a> installation. 

<ul class="list"><li class="list">set as default gives an error message on opening new instance.</li><li class="list">cannot reuse windows, although this should be standard setting.</li></ul>

After some time I installed 0.8 again and everything worked fine. Then I installed <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox 0.9</a> again. Created a new profile, and I still had the same problems. 

Now everything works as it should be by using the <a href="http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#Tb">tabbed browser</a> extension, where you can specify "a single window" setting.

The strange thing is, that it seems that I'm only person who's experiencing these issues. So, probably my pc is messed up. Suggestions are welcome :)

<em>On a sidenote, 0.9 is really faster then 0.8</em>

<strong>update:</strong> I give up, at least for the time being. I thought the tabbed browser extension solved my problems but in the end it didn't. Too much of a hassle. I will try again once I know what's going on. It's a shame though. :(
