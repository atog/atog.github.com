we saw another house yesterday... the house was pretty good maintained, new windows, new roof,... you could see the owner took good care of it. but (always a but :)) the location wasn't good.

tonight we go see two other houses. i have pretty high expectations of the second one and i don't really know what to think of the first one. oh well, we'll see.
