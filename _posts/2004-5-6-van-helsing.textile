<a href="http://www.vanhelsing.net/"><img class="right" src="http://atog.be/p/m/vanhelsing.jpg" alt="Van Helsing" /></a>The movie of this week is <a href="http://www.vanhelsing.net/">Van Helsing</a> starring <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0413168/">Hugh Jackman</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000295/">Kate Beckinsale</a>. 

At times it was very exciting and some of the effects were very good. But then again, it's hard to find a movie these days without great effects. The one and only thing which spoiled the movie, but <strong>really spoiled</strong>, was the guy who played Count Vladislaus Dracula, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0746896/">Richard Roxburgh</a>. If you talk about bad acting, this guy should win the first prize. It was terrible, really.

So I'll rate it 6/10.
