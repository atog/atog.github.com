<a href="http://kingarthur.movies.go.com/main.html"><img src="http://atog.be/p/m/kingarthur.jpg" class="left" alt="King Arthur" /></a>We went to see <a href="http://kingarthur.movies.go.com/main.html">King Arthur</a> yesterday. It wasn't bad but it's not really very good either. It was entertainment and in the end that's the only thing  a movie has to be.  Good action, but when you compare it like for instance with the battlefields of <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">LOTR</a>. mm, huge difference.

About a rating, I'm not exactly sure, I would say between 5 and 7. What I do know for sure is: I won't buy it on dvd. ;)
