title: Java debugger
---
I never actually used a debugger before, when coding in Java. Always played with a <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">logger</a> or the well-known : <code>System.out.print</code>.  But <a href="http://www.lambdacs.com/debugger/debugger.html">this  debugger</a> has caught my attention :)

<blockquote>The debugger works by collecting "time stamps" which record everything that happens in a program. A GUI then allows you to navigate backwards in time to look at objects, variables, method calls, etc. <a href="http://www.lambdacs.com/debugger/debugger.html">[more]</a>
