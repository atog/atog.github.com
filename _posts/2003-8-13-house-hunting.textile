tonight were going to "visit" two houses. it's been a while now since the last one (almost a week and a half). the first one needs some renovation and we don't know the price yet, the second one is already renovated (actually they are renovating it as we speak) and we do know the price :)

...i've got already two new appointments for next week :p
