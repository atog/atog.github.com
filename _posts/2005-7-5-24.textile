Last week we started watching <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a>, the first season. We missed it on television and as we are watching it now, I'm glad we missed it. I don't think I have could waited each time a few days to see the next episode.

This is one damn good serie folks!! I love it! And there is another good thing too, Sien doesn't fall asleep whatching these, not even when we see two or three episodes in a row :)

We started watching on Monday and by Sunday we had already seen twelve hours (= 12 episodes).  Yesterday we didn't had the time, but today, yes yes yes ;)
