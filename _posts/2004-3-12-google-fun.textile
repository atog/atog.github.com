Ok, I knew you could do some strange/fun/useful searches with <a href="http://google.com">google</a> but I never really thought about it. I just used it.

Until now. I just read <em><a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/224">Googling up passwords</a></em> and I must say, there is a difference in using it (<a href="http://google.com">google</a>) or reading about it.  Interesting.
