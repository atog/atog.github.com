<strong>&lt;dancing around pretty happy /&gt;</strong>

Before, I had the <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/review/siemens-cl50-en.shtml">Siemens CL50</a>, besides it's size I was never really happy with it. Awful menu. k, I chose it myself and I got it for my birthday but I hope I made better choice yesterday. Don't want no Siemens ever again.

The T630 has a lot of nifty features, so I guess I go RTFM :D
