Zullen we beginnen met wat [RubyFest](http://rubyfest.nl/) is?

> RubyFest is a Dutch user group of the Ruby programming language. We're focussed on Ruby users in the South of the Netherlands and the Flemish part of Belgium. However, every Ruby enthusiast is very welcome at our meetups!

**Hoe? Wat? Waarom?** Wel, ik vond dit deze namiddag in mijn mailbox:

> Dear (Ruby) Software Developer,

>We would like to invite you to join us during the first edition of RubyFest! RubyFest is a meetup/mini-conference for software developers working with - or interested in - the programming language Ruby. RubyFest is scheduled to take place on May 14th in Eindhoven (NL). We will start in the afternoon with two (technical) presentations, the first presentation will be given by Ariejan de Vroom (Kabisa ICT) about Git and the second presentation slot will be filled with a live video presentation by Geoffrey Grosenbach (Topfunky Corporation, Peepcode Screencasts) and a short Q&A session with Geoffrey. The presentation section will be followed by an informal gathering as an opportunity to get in touch with the community in our region.

Natuurlijk zal ik er zijn. [Meer info @ eventbrite](http://rubyfest-may-2009.eventbrite.com/).
