in <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/">this article</a> <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/archives/2004/01/13/faux_columns_at_a_list_apart.html">Dan</a> describes how to extend positioned or floated columns to full browser heights, regardless of each columnâ€™s contents. as you may or may not have noticed, i'm having the same problem here with the column on the left.

so apparently it should be fairly easy to fix, but first things first : our house.
