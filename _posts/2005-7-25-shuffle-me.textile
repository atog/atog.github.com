Happy (yesterday) birthday to me!! :D

I hear you, what's the number? 27.

My wife and <a href="http://www.division.be">brother</a>(s) got me a nice and trendy <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. From my friends I got <a href="http://www.beerpassion.com/">lot's of beer</a>, which is of course, something I love. 
To get some work done in our house, and to get a decent mailbox (which we really need), I received <a href="http://hubo.be/nl/index.cfm">gift certifact<strong>s</strong> from "den Hubo"</a> from everybody else in my family.

Oh I love these birthdays!! <em>they force me to get some work done</em> :P
