i just added <a href="http://www.atog.be/gallery/our_house_progress">some pictures</a> of the work in our new house.  these pictures were taken, i think, around last friday... new stuff is already coming up :p

in the mean time we discovered we'll have a lot more work to do then we thought (e.g.  completely new electricity), but i guess in way that is normal when you buy a 50-year old house.

i still got another week before i need to get back to work-work (the job that pays the bills :p),  and we're already ahead on schedule...ssst don't tell anyone :)
