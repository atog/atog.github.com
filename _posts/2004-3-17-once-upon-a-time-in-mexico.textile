<table><tr><td><a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/onceuponatimeinmexico/"><img src="http://atog.be/p/mexico.png" border=0 alt="One upon a time in Mexico" /></a></td><td>Yes finally! I'm waiting since 25 december 2003 on the release of this movie (in Belgium), cause I thought it would be released that date. Damn, I was wrong! :) lol</td></tr></table>

It's rated fresh (71%) on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/OnceUponaTimeinMexico-1125404/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> so it can't be bad, can it? As usual, I'll post a rating once I've seen it.

<strong>update</strong>: k, it wasn't that good at all. <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000136/">Depp</a> really saves the movie. I'll rate it a 6/10, because it was entertaining. :p
