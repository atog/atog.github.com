title: java.sun.com iexplorer only?
---
damn, unbelievable... i just did a search on suns' java forums (<a href='http://search.java.sun.com/search/java/advanced.jsp'>advanced search</a>) using mozilla firebird.
ok, i get some results...but i couldn't open them! there was not one single link on the results-page! so i thought : hey let's open the page in iexplorer and guess what? it worked!!

luckily we have something that's called "<b>standards</b>" :p

<b>update:</b>
apparently i'm the only one experiencing this problem, it seems to work fine on <a href='http://blogs.cocoondev.org/tomk/'>tomK's</a> side (at least the only one of both of us :))
