<blockquote><i>Was there a Victim?

Most crimes have victims. In this case, the felony charge was not because someone was harmed, but because of a story written (deemed a plan). When committing a crime, someone (victim) is usually hurt. The only person hurt (victim) appears to be the person charged. Twisted irony. But this is not a victimless crime.

like i said, unbelievable.
