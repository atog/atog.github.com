the house we saw yesterday was bad, really bad. i can't say anything else about it, there is no bathroom and the toilet is in the garden. pfff.

remember i <a href='http://atog.typepad.com/atog/2003/08/househunting_3.html'>said</a> we were going to look at two houses, well here it comes, we didn't find the second house anymore *lol* we just couldn't find it. the "for-sale" sign was gone and we didn't know the house-number so...too bad. it must be sold already then, i can't think of another reason...
