new stuff from the kazaa people: <a href='http://skype.com/'>Skype</a>

from their site:

<blockquote style='background-color:#FFEFEF'>Skype is the next phenomenon from the people who brought you KaZaA. Just like KaZaA, Skype uses P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to connect you to other users Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to share files this time, but to talk for free with your friends.

The technology is extremely advanced - but super simple to use... YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be making perfect quality free phone calls to your friends in no time! Just tell them to get Skype as well, if they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already have it.</blockquote>

sounds good doesn't it :)

<b>update:</b>
as i was told by <a href='http://blogs.cocoondev.org/tomk/'>tomk</a>, you should definitely read the <a href='http://skype.com/eula.html'>end user license agreement</a>
