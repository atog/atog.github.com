According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/36091.html">this article</a>, teens are getting classes in Tolkien's Elvish. :p

<blockquote>&lt;quote&gt;... Knowing Sindarin is useful when giving orders to their Elvish armies ... &lt;/quote&gt; <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/36091.html">[more]</a></blockquote>

helloo?!? giving orders to their Elvish armies?!? Come on, I like <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">the movies</a> too but this goes way beyond my imagination. lol
