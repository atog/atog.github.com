<a href="http://milliondollarbabymovie.warnerbros.com/home.html"><img src="http://atog.be/p/m/milliondollar.jpg" class="right" alt="Million Dollar Baby" /></a> Damn, it's been a long time since I saw such a good, and I mean <strong>good!</strong>, movie. Good acting all over the place. From <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000142/">Clint Eastwood</a> to <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0005476/">Hilary Swank</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000151/">Morgan Freeman</a>, all three of them did a terrific job.

I'm not gonna spoil it, all I <strong>can</strong> and <strong>should</strong> say is : <em>Go see it, it's worth it.</em>

In case you missed the title of this post, it's a <a href="http://milliondollarbabymovie.warnerbros.com/home.html">Million Dollar Baby</a> I'm talking about. :P

My rating? 9.5/10. Over at <a href="http://www.cinenews.be/Movies.Detail.cfm?MoviesID=2548&lang=nl">cinenews.be it received 8.3/10</a> so far. When looking at rottentomatoes, it's <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/million_dollar_baby/">certified fresh with 91%</a>.

Do you feel my enthusiasm? ;) Still not convinced?
