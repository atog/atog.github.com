<a href="http://atog.be/photos/?album=1"><img src="http://atog.be/p/r/r.jpg" class="left" alt="Heron in our garden" /></a>You're never going to believe this: we just (10 minutes ago) had a visit from a heron ("ne reiger" for the flemish). Maybe that's the most common thing where you live, but here, where we live it sure isn't. At least, not in the garden.

I've put 2 pics of the heron in my freshly installed version of <a href="http://atog.be/photos/?album=1">photostack</a>.  I still need to integrate it (photostack that is) with my blog, but then again, I need to do a lot of things with my blog. :P
