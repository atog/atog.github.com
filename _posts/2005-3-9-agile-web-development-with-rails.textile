This is probably gonna be the first book on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">rails</a>:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>

A new approach to web development:
<ul><li>develop sophisticated web applications quickly and easily;</li><li>use incremental and iterative development to create the web apps that users want; and</li><li>get to go home on time.</li></ul>
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">[more]</a></blockquote>

Nice! ;)
