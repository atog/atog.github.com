<a href="http://www.thegirlnextdoormovie.com/"><img src="http://atog.be/p/m/tgnextd.jpg" class="right" alt="The Girl Next Door" /></a>I saw <a href="http://www.thegirlnextdoormovie.com/">The Girl Next Door</a> yesterday. I liked it. Nothing more, nothing less.

I hear you: "<em>Why?</em>" 

Well, it's funny, kind of romantic, you don't have use you're brains, you know in advance it's a happy end and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0193846/">Elisha Cuthbert</a> is good looking. ;)

Entertaining, I think I said this before, but that's the only basic thing a movie has to be.

I'll give it a 6/10.
