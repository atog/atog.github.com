Today was the last day I worked in Edegem, eventually I'll be back, but as of next week I'll be working for a customer in Venlo.
Sounds like <em>far away</em>, well it's quite some distance, 144km to be precise. That is a commute of a bit less then 3hrs everyday.

@Office in Edegem: I hope we will be reunited someday.
