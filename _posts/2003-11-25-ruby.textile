for over the past week i started looking into  <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby</a>, just out of curiosity and i'm really starting to like it :)

so for now i put these links here to an interview at <a href="http://artima.com">artima</a> with ruby's creator : Yukihiro Matsumoto. i haven't read them yet, will do some so when i got a free moment :)
