title: Short names.

Small but _sometimes_ useful tip:
<code>dir /X</code>

p. When you enter the above command on a command prompt in windows, you'll get to see the short names (8 chars) for those extra long dir/filenames.

p. e.g. <code>"C:\Documents and Settings"</code> becomes <code>"C:\DOCUME~1"</code>
