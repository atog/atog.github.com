another great <a href="http://mozilla.org/">mozilla firebird</a> extension : <a href="http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/#EditCSS">EditCSS</a>

from the author:
<blockquote>EditCSS is a useful extension for web developers and web designers, that works for MozillaFirebird. It allows you to edit current stylesheets of a page in live, and display the result as you type. It appears in a sidebar. The project is based on Jesse Ruderman's "Edit Style" bookmarklet, that has done the essential work.</blockquote>
