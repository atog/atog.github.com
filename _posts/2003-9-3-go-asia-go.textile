i wish there were more initiatives like <a href='http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,7129744%5E15321%5E%5Enbv%5E15306,00.html'>this:	Asia to develop Windows rival</a> :)

<blockquote>Japan, China and South Korea plan to develop an original operating system in a bid to challenge the domination of Microsoft Windows.<br>
...<br>
The governments of the three countries will consider subsidising the project...</blockquote>

go go go! :)  a bit more competition is healty.
