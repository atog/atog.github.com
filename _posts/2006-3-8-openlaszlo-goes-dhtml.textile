title: OpenLaszlo goes DHTML.
---
"OpenLaszlo":http://www.openlaszlo.org/ "announced":http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2006/03/openlaszlo-goes-dhtml/ their first alternative runtime: DHTML, all effects included. Pretty cool if you ask me. Check out the demo, you hardly see any difference between the flash and dhtml version. Nifty.

* "Flash version":http://labs.openlaszlo.org/lzpix-flash
* "DHTML version":http://labs.openlaszlo.org/lzpix-dhtml

both versions run from the same "source file":http://labs.openlaszlo.org/lzpix-source. This makes a great tool even greater!
