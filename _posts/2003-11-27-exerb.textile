<em>Exerb is the software which converts scripts/extension-libraries of the object oriented language Ruby into a Windows executable file which can execute alone and independently.</em>

at the moment i'm playing around with ruby (still learning), trying to build a rss-aggregator and a tool to publish to my weblog. fun fun fun :p
