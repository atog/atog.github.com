last week we made two new appointments...and a couple of hours later the brokers called us back to say that  house was already sold, both of them :(

i guess if it's a good buy, you have to be quick. damn.

tonight we go see another house, but i don't think that will be a good one cause it's been for sale for quiet some time now... but then again you never know, do you? :p
