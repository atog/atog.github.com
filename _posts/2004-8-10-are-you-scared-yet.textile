If so, you should buy this <a href="http://www.qsleeper.com/index.html">bed</a>. It even comes with options for a microwave, refrigerator and much much more!

<em>quote from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/09/creepy_bed_doubles_a.html">Boing Boing</a></em>
<blockquote>It also comes with a stereo system, so you can listen to music while a demented axe murderer attempts to chop through the polycarbonate barrier.</blockquote>

so, are you scared yet? :D
