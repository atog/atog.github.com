title: Wedding. Party!
---
Tomorrow I'll be the best man at my best friends wedding. We know each other for about +20 years and he was best man at my wedding.  By tomorrow morning I will be as nervous as I can get because I've been asked to read something in church. Nothing from the Bible, no sir, I had to write my own (which is good of course)!

Looking at the weather from the past couple of days, I hope it will be much better tomorrow. Actually, much  much much better. It's been really bad, it's only the end of August and it feels like summer's already over. 

Oh man, I do love Belgium. :D
