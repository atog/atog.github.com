<a href="http://atog.be/photos/?album=smart"><img src="http://atog.be/photos/storage/thumb-smart-smart1.jpg.png" class="left" alt="Smart for sale" /></a>Anyone interested in buying a Smart? Very nice and good car.  :D

It's almost new, we bought it in January 2002 and the car now only has 18000KM, not bad if you ask me. It has a glass roof and many other nice options. Price: 6800 euros.

So if you're living in Belgium and want a nice car, let me know!
