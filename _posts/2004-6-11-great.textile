Someone needed my assistance on his W2K installation due to various virusses. (Agobot, Sasser, ...) After downloading a security patch (6MB, regular phone line, 40 min) I tried to install the damn thing. As this W2K installation hasn't got any service packs installed, the patch wouldn't work. 

<em>You need at least service pack 2</em>

<blockquote>This person only uses his pc for email, nothing more nothing less.  He also never updated his installation because he didn't know he had to. No broadband connection.</blockquote>

Ok then, let's install service pack 4.  mm, 132MB, regular phone line, no way I was going to do that.
So I decided to go home and download it via my broadband connection, burn it on cd and install.  Sounds good to me and it definitley should be faster, no?

Think again. Goto Microsoft. Press the download button. Starts... 11kb/sec...equals about 3hrs! 
Alternative step. Look for mirrors. Mirrors?

About 2.5hrs later, I return to my laptop (a father needs to do some other things too) to find out that the bloody thing went into standby-mode.  I totally forgot this would happen. :(

...start all over again. 3hrs.
