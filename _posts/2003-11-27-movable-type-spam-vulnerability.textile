title: Movable Type spam vulnerability
---
<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_11.shtml#000873">apparently</a>  if you use movable type, spammers could abuse the MT-script : <em>mt-send-entry.cgi</em> to send their mails. the best solution to avoid this is to just delete the script on your server.
