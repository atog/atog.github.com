title: eclipse and it's market share
---
according <a href="http://www.qa-systems.com/products/qstudioforjava/ide_marketshare.html">this survey</a> eclipse is currently the IDE with the largest market share of 45%, followed by Borland JBuilder with 16% and IDEA IntelliJ with 10%.

my personal favourite is <a href="http://intellij.com">IDEA</a> but it's CVS support in 3.0 is really terrible compared to what <a href="http://eclipse.org">eclipse</a> has to offer (in terms of CVS support :))
i never used JBuilder though, so i don't know about that one...but eclipse does a very good job in being an IDE :p
