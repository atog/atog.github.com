It's been awful quiet up here for the last week. I've had a couple of days off and on Saturday it was my birthday (26). So party party party :D

As of now you can expect some newbie-linux-experiences too cause I managed to install <a href="http://slackware.com">Slackware 10</a> last week.  Exciting isn't it :P
