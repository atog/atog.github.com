oh oh, i almost forgot :) we saw a beautiful house yesterday. this is the first house we both really like. i think i would like to live there. so we're going to think about it for a bit, then we go back on monday and then we'll see what happens :p

btw. we're going to look at another 2 houses tonight, maybe they are even better...
