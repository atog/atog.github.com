This is just outrageous. How can a child be the prize in a reality show? The show is called "Be My Baby". Five couples will play a game to win/adopt a baby. It was even on <a href="http://stubru.be">Belgian radio</a> this morning.

Found it on the net via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/04/29/realitytv_human_baby.html">Boing Boing</a> and here's the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/19700.htm/">NY Post article</a>.

I wonder how they even found these 5 couples! Who would participate in something like this?
