title: Firefox problems fixed
---
As I <a href="http://atog.be/archives/2004/06/17/firefox-weirdness/">posted previously</a>, I had some problems with the new version of <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.

So today, first day back at work, I installed <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">the update (Firefox 0.9.1)</a>.  

After this new installation I still had the same problems related to the default browser behaviour.
Solution: <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/firefox_bug_246078.asp">this registry patch</a>

Next problem was that it was still opening new windows from external programs.
Solution: <a href="http://www.mozthemes.tk/">the single window extension</a>

...now I'm fine. Happy browsing. Still, these issues should be solved in a next release.
