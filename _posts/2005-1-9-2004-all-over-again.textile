title: 2004 all over again.
---
How come? Last year in January <a href="http://atog.be/archives/2004/01/04/work-in-progress-1/">we started working in our newly bought house</a>, remember the pictures? :)

Well, this year, January,  which is <strong>now</strong>, my sister-in-law started working in their newly bought house.  Since they bought a house in our street, it's almost identical to ours.  So, same house, same age, same amount of work. Not exactly the same work, everybody has his own style but still, the basics are the same.

I hope the work will progress at a steady pace, and I will help wherever I can, hence the title of this post. 

The good thing this year is that I don't have to do the thinking. ;)
