Just when you think summer is over, the Belgian weather-gods provide you with a 30Ã‚Â° weekend. Unbelievable. Very good of course, but still, unbelievable.

On Sunday we went for a hike (only 7 km) with a very large part of Sien's family.  Something between 60 and 70 people, somewhere in Lichtaart. It was nice.  I didn't really want to go but in the end it turned out to be very pleasant.
