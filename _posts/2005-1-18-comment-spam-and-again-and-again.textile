Bloody hell! I could start swearing for hours and hours... 

Ok, I'm kalm now. It's all right now. 

Things like this make a person install things like <a href="http://mookitty.co.uk/devblog/category/comment-killer">Comment Killer</a>.  So keep in mind that from now on when you post a comment that will be put in the moderation queue, it will be automagically deleted. So be careful with what you post boys! ;)

Nevermind, as long as you keep it clean, nothing will be deleted. Mm, should I actually say something like that?  :P
