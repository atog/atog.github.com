It looks like <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> is speeding things up with <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a>. Last week I received 6 invites, of which I only had send 4 yet. Today, I'm back at 6 invites. 

I'll better get rid of them ;)

As for <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> as a service, I'm pretty happy with it. It's nice, works good, and I like the way conversations are displayed.
