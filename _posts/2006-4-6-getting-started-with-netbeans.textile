Two "NetBeans":http://www.netbeans.org tutorials on Web applications:
* "NetBeans IDE 5.0 Quick Start Guide for Web Applications":http://www.netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-webapps.html
* "NetBeans IDE 5.0 Quick Start Guide for Web Applications II":http://www.netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-webapps-2.html

When you briefly go through them you also get a nice overview of what there is to find in "NetBeans":http://www.netbeans.org
