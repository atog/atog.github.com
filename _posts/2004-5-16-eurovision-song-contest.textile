But apart from the fact I thought <a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/english/belgium.htm">we</a> should have won, the whole televoting sucked big time. Come on, nobody listened to the songs. If they had listened, we would have won. No, just kidding :)

Every country voted for their neighboring countries. It was just too obvious, and there's no fun in that, is there? They need to rethink the voting system cause the way it is now (the televoting) is ridiculous.

I don't think I'll watch next year, but then again that's what I say every year :)
