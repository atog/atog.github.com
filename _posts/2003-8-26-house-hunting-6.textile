yesterdays house, we're just gonna look further for another one.

what happened? well we took our own expert (family, but prof. expert) and he said:

<blockquote><i>well, the house is ok, it's in good shape, very good maintained ... but ... they are asking 25.000 euros above it's estimated value.</i></blockquote>

and when i heard that, i didn't want it anymore :)

so as usual, up to the next one :) *lol*
