<a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/index.htm">This BSD distro</a> certainly caught my attention: <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/index.htm">PC-BSD</a>. A user-friendly <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD-based</a> operating system. Sounds good, doesn't it?

Vision-quote:
<blockquote>... To create a desktop OS using the FreeBSD platform, that can be used by business and home users as easily as the leading major operating systems, while still retaining the power-functionality of UNIX that makes FreeBSD such a solid platform. <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/index.htm">[more]</a></blockquote>

Note to myself: try it out.
