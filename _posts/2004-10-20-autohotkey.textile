Nifty! <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> a simple scripting language for windows in which you can define shortcut keys and hotstrings.  Damn I like it a lot! 


Here's my test case, as described in the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm">quick start tutorial</a>:

<code>#z::Run www.google.com
::btw::by the way</code>

save this as a .ahk file. Double-click on it and it's running.

Now you can press "the windows key" + z to go to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> (the first line) --- or as of now when you type "btw" it will automagically be replace by "by the way" (second line).
