Weeral een reden waarom "Opera":http://www.opera.com superieur is ;)

bq. *TIP!* Going back and forward in the window history with ease. <br /><br />
This is mentioned in the documentation, but often overlooked.<br />
Some mice have a dedicated back and forward button for Web browsers. If your mouse does not have these, or it doesn't work in Opera for some reason, there's a way which is almost as easy:
<br /><br />*To go back*: Hold down the right mouse button, click left button.<br /><br />
*To go forward*: Hold the left button, click right button.<br /><br />
This lets you flick back and forward between pages in the window's history.
