<strong>[update 04/03]</strong> I'm already tired of it. Drop it. Way too slow. Maybe I was too excited, who knows.


<a href="http://wists.com/everyone"><img src="http://atog.be/p/r/wists.gif" class="left" alt="Wists. Visual bookmarks." /></a> Another nice new service, just like <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, but with a decent interface, bookmarks associated with images, private and public lists, and some other useful features. I didn't use <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, but I'm sure gonna try this one. 

<a href="http://wists.com/koen">Here's mine</a>, there's nothing in there yet, except a small test-bookmark-thingy.
