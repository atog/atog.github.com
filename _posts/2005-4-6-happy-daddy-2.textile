title: Happy daddy (2).
---
Tomorrow it will be 1 year <a href="http://atog.be/archives/2004/04/08/happy-daddy/">since I became a <strong>happy daddy</strong></a>! Unbelievable how fast time goes by. One year already and still it feels like Arwen just entered this world.

Anyways we're having a <strong>big</strong> party, actually 2 parties, one on Thursday and one on Sunday ;)
So to make sure I don't have to miss a single thing I gonna take some days off (Thursday, Friday <em>and</em> Monday). Party, Party, Party!!

Tsjak, tjak!!
