I really like the design of <a href="http://phonophunk.phreakin.com/">this site (blog)</a>. Cool!

Makes me want to redesign my own blog. I've been thinking on that for a while now, but as usual, time isn't really on my side. :p

1. Still working in our house. - high priority -
2. Redesign blog (but I still don't have an internet-connection at home, it can be quite handy sometimes)
3. Getting into Swing, reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/193011088X/ref=pd_sr_ec_ir_b/202-0985453-9279818">a book</a> and learning it by developing a descent editor. (<a href="http://atog.be/p/mine.png">This</a> is what I got so far...)

You see, time is NOT on my side. But we're negotiating. :)
