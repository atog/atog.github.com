Let's start with the bad news, shall we?

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/36540.html">Apple delays world iPod Mini launch</a>

Next, the good news, altough it doesn't really changes much.

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/63/36558.html">Hitachi to boost 1in HDD output</a>

...but then again, it's only a gadget, isn't it?
(I have to keep repeating that to myself, in order not to buy it)
