i tried the demo  (fully functional version) of <a href='http://westciv.com/style_master/index.html'>Style Master 3</a> today. it looks pretty neat, i think i'm gonna use it for a couple off days... at least this is not a product that you try for 5 seconds and think: djee why did i ever wanted to install this shit!

so far so good :)

i found it via <a href='http://zeldman.com'>zeldman</a>
