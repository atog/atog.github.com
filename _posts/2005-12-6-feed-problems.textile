title: Feed problems?
---
I just got word from a colleague of mine that my feed is pretty messed up. Every post shows up more than once or
everyday all items appear to be new.

If someone experiences similar problems, please let me know. It's either a "feedburner":http://www.feedburner.com or 
"typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com bug.

*update*: I modified feedburner to use my atom feed (before it was rss 2.0), maybe that will be better. Anyways, let me know.
