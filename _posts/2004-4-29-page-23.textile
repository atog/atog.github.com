It's funny how fast/slow something spreads itself on the net. If you don't know yet what I'm talking about, it's this bit of text:

<blockquote><em>Grab the nearest book.
Open the book to page 23.
Find the fifth sentence.
Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions</em></blockquote>

I don't know who really started it, most of the people who posted it provided a link to the ones they got it from, so I tracked it "all the way" back to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/skelkins/2243.html">Notes from the tundra, on April 8th 2004</a>. Before that it looks like it was an extensive Q&A list. So maybe the honors go to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/skelkins/">Notes from the tundra</a>

I refused to do it before, so why should I do it now?
No I won't grab a book. :)
