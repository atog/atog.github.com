title: The Bourne Supremacy.

<a href="http://www.thebournesupremacy.com/"><img src="http://atog.be/p/m/bourne2.jpg" alt="The Bourne Supremacy" class="left" /></a>As yesterday <a href="http://www.thebournesupremacy.com/">The Bourne Supremacy</a> was released here in Belgium, I had to see it of course.  I really loved <a href="http://www.thebourneidentity.com/">The Bourne Identity</a> so I figured the new one had to be good as well. 

I was right. It is a terrific movie. 

The following <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bourne_supremacy/">quote</a> from <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com">rottentomatoes.com</a> really captures it:

<cite> "If you've forgotten the kick you get from watching a globe-trotting, butt-kicking, whiplash-paced action movie done with humor, style and smarts, take a ride with The Bourne Supremacy."
-- Peter Travers, ROLLING STONE</cite>

I'll give it a 9/10.
