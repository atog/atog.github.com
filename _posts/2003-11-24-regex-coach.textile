the <a href="http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/">Regex Coach</a> seems to be one damn useful application. it let's you interactively experiment with regular expressions.

if only i could download it :( i tried it a couple of times and they were all corrupted. will give it another try tomorrow.

<strong>update</strong>: the download worked...and it is one fine application!
