<a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/item/133.cfm">Pete</a> launched <a href="http://javadocs.org">javadocs.org</a> yesterday. It's an easy way to access the java api. <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> is not bad at that either, but still, this can be pretty useful.

There is also a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/searchlets/">search engine plugin</a> available which makes it even more useful. :D
