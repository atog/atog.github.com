title: Wordpress 1.2.1
---
I just upgraded to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">wordpress 1.2.1</a> which is kind of a bugfix release.
<blockquote>This release addresses a few bugs and minor security issues with 1.2. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also backported the new login system from 1.3 that is much friendlier and should address many of the problems people have had with logging in and cookies.</blockquote>

If anyone experiences any problems here, let me know ;)
