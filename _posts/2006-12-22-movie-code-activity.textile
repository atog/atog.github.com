Een goeie opsomming van al wat code *niet* doet van wat het *wel* doet in films: "What code DOESN'T do in real life (that it does in the movies)":http://www.drivl.com/posts/view/494

# Code does not move.
# Code is not green text on a black background.
# Code has structure.
# Code is not three dimensional.
# Code does not make blip noises as it appears on the screen.
# Code cannot be cracked by an 8 year old kid in a matter of seconds.
# Not all code is meant to be cracked.
# Code isn't just 0100110 010101 10100 011.
# People who write code use mice.
# Most code is not inherently cross platform.

Go on, "read it":http://www.drivl.com/posts/view/494, I'm sure it will put a smile on your face. :)
