I just found out (via <a href="http://www.gva.be">Gazet van Antwerpen</a>) that since yesterday evening <a href="http://www.apple.com/benl/itunes/"> iTunes is available in Belgium</a>. Great!

You can buy one song for 0.99 cents and an album starting from 9.99 euros. That's not too bad, me thinks. ;)
