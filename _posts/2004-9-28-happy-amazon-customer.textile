I can't get used to it.

Last week I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932394117/qid=1096354102/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-9596005-7100437"><em>Tapestry in Action</em></a> and 2 working days later I got it in my hands. 

I will <strong>never</strong> forget the time when I ordered a book at <a href="http://www.standaardboek.com/">a local bookshop</a>, it took them 3 months before I finally got it!

Go <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a>! ;)
