Before last Sunday, it was already some time ago I went to the cinema. But as I said, <em>before last Sunday</em>. :P

On Sunday I saw <a href="http://www.nationaltreasure.com">National Treasure</a>. I thought it was pretty good. Pure entertainment, it has all the necessary ingredients what makes a movie entertaining.  Over at <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/national_treasure/">rottentomatoes.com it get's only 42%</a>, that's a bit too low IMO, at <a href="http://www.cinenews.be/Movies.Detail.cfm?MoviesId=897&lang=nl">cinenews.be it receives 7.3/10</a>, which I think is more like it.

I'll rate it 7/10.

Now <em>yesterday</em> my wife and me went to see <a href="http://oceans12.warnerbros.com/">Ocean's Twelve</a>.  As usual with these sequels, the first one (<a href="http://www.warnerbros.co.uk/movies/oceans11/">Ocean's Eleven</a>), was much better.  We did have a good time, so it wasn't <strong>that</strong> bad. This one gets <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oceans_twelve/">58% over at rottentomatoes.com</a> and again a <a href="http://www.cinenews.be/Movies.Detail.cfm?MoviesId=1081&lang=nl">7/10 at cinenews.be</a>

In my book it gets a 6/10.

I hope this week was a start of me going back to movies every week.  Who knows? ;)
