I think my expectations were too high so I don't really know what to think of it.  Anyways, I went with <a href="http://www.division.be">my brother</a> and we had good fun. 

What more can I say, I simply enjoy watching movies.  :P

<a href="http://constantinemovie.warnerbros.com/">Constantine</a> get's a 5/10 in my book.  Not much I know, but it wasn't <em>that</em> good either.
Actually I've should have known better cause it's rated 46% at <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/constantine/">rottentomatoes.com</a>

Next one on my list: <a href="http://www.hideandseekthemovie.com/home.html">Hide and Seek</a>. 

<strong>[update]</strong> mm, I just searched for <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hide_and_seek/">Hide and Seek on rottentomatoes</a> and it's rated only 14%!!  ... where is my list again? euhm ;)
