Yuk, I hate Notes. Just now, I accidently pressed F5, a refresh habit and you know what happened?

The bloody thing just logs me out and exits! I don't think that's the kind of behaviour I was expecting, now was I?

Stupid program. Every shortcut widely known across different windows programs doesn't work in Notes. Go figure.

<em>k, I'm fine now. Thanks for listening.</em>
