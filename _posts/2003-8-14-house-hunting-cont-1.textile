*lol* noticed the number in the title? i have a feeling i will post a lot on my house-hunting so i'll number my posts :)

yesterday was terrible, actually horrible is a better word:

the first house will be sold in an auction, it is the result of a divorce. now two times a week people can visit the house to check it out, or at least should be able to visit the house...so yesterday, we arrived at the house, we rang the bell, mmm, nothing happened...we make a call to the notary. someone answers the phone, we tell our story and she replies (in summary)<i>"ok, these people don't want to cooperate, next time you want to see the house, take the police with you."</i>  can you imagine that?!? did you ever hear something like that? someone wants to sell his house but you have to visit it accompanied by the police! <i>incredible</i>

the second house was even more fun :p...

... we just saw the hallway. as i said yesterday, it's being renovated as we speak...nothing is more true!! there are five rooms in the house and they are all rented. ok, that's fine by me...but no one was home! how the hell can you sell a house when you can't even let people check it out.
after we walked through the hallway the broker asks us: <i>"do you like the style of the house?"</i>
Hello! we just saw the hallway, am i supposed to imagine how the rest of house looks like!

i'll hope the next ones will be better...
