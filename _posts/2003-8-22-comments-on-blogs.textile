i think its sad to see comments like <a href='http://www.werner.be/blog/comments/werner?anchor=considering_outsourcing_to_cheaper_labour'>this</a>...

<blockquote><i>Using political correctness as a barometer makes you a drone, and a wimp... and a brown-shirt.</i></blockquote>

...and posted anonymously.
IMHO if you make such a comment, you have to, at least, let the author know who wrote the comment. it's just as cowardly as it can get. it's like shitting on someones head and then run off before the person actually realises what happened.
