<em>De Samourai in 't stad.</em>

Let me explain that sentence in english:
<ul class="list"><li class="list">De Samourai : The Samourai, a Japanese restaurant.</li><li class="list">in 't stad : in the city. When we say here in Belgium "<em>the city</em>", we are referring to Antwerp ;)</li></ul>

So we went there yesterday. My advice to the world: don't go there on a Sunday. Besides us, there was only one other table.  There was more personell then guests! k, there's nothing wrong with that but we had 5 courses in 1.30hrs and that's <strong>wrong</strong> in my opinion.

Now for the good part: food was excellent and we were in very good company. :)
