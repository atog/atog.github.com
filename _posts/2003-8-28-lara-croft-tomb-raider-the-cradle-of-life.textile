we saw <a href='http://www.tombraidermovie.com/html/index.html'>it</a> yesterday. it was fun, i think it's like a combination of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/Title?0246460'>james bond</a> and <a href='http://www.imdb.com/Title?0097576'>indiana jones</a> :)
compared to the first one, the second is better: better story, better effects and she's even more good-looking.
i tell you, speaking of pretty lady... :)

conclusion : it was entertaining, and that's what it's supposed to be, isn't it? so it was good.
