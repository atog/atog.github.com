<a href="http://www.collateral-themovie.com/"><img src="http://atog.be/p/r/collateral.jpg" alt="Collateral" class="left" /></a>Since Sien (my wife) started with daycare on Sept. 1st, she wants to get out once in while. As in <em>do something fun at night</em>. When your work environment is the same place as your home, I can definitely understand that.

So went to see <a href="http://www.collateral-themovie.com/">Collateral</a> yesterday. It was the first time since Arwen was born, that's almost 6 months ago, she came along. Arwen stayed with my dad. 

Tom Cruise did a very good job playing a hitman. I had high hopes because it was rated <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movies/certified_fresh.php"><em>"Certified Fresh"</em></a> at <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/collateral/">rottentomatoes.com</a>. They proved to be right. It's a very good movie. Totally my style ;)

I'll give it a 9/10
