Comment spam. pfff. It's a real pain. I just deleted 61 comments (which were in "awaiting approval" mode) from only 3 different ip-addresses.

Come on do these guys really don't have anything better to do. It's a effort for nothing as well cause these comments are never shown. 

Hello spammers! I'm using <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a>! :P
