"The Caboose Sample App is starting to look very good (v3)!":http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2007/4/11/sample-rails-application.

In summary it contains:
* a user model with a few extra fields (last login, timezones)
* restful authentication
* simple authorization (can't edit other's profiles)
* full timezone support
* basic views implemented with Yahoo! YUI CSS grids
* behavioral testing with rspec
* exception notification 
* nested resources which can easily be extended
* polymorphic image model
* around_filters to set and clear request-specific data

Dat moeten we allemaal toch is bekijken, ik weet vanavond op de trein weer al wat doen :)
