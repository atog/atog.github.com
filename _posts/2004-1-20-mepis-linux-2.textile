title: MEPIS Linux (2)
---
last night i downloaded and burned the two iso's...brought it to work this morning...put the disc in my pc and guess what? one/two minutes later i was running <a href="http://www.mepis.org">mepis linux</a>! :)

it works like a charm. sweet!

tonight i'll try it on <a href="http://www.shop.toshiba.be/products/Toshiba_product.asp?PRef=PSA15E018PCBT">my laptop</a>, if that works perfect as well, i might go for the hd-install. :p
