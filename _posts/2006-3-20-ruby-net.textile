Just like there is a "ruby for the jvm":http://jruby.sourceforge.net/ Queensland University of Technology now started development of "a ruby compiler for the .NET CLR":http://www.plas.fit.qut.edu.au/rubynet/ and apparantly it's "funded by Microsoft":http://blog.curthibbs.us/articles/2006/03/17/ruby-net

Maybe some day we'll be able to run Ruby on Rails on .NET ;)
