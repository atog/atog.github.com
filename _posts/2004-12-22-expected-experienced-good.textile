This evening, about 3 hrs ago, we went to the <a href="http://www.wijnegemshoppingcenter.be/wsc/home.html">Wijnegem Shopping Center</a>... yes I know what you think. I thought the very same thing and I was prepared for the worst case scenario.

In case you're not from Belgium, or even Antwerp, and you're not familiar with the <a href="http://www.wijnegemshoppingcenter.be/wsc/home.html">Wijnegem Shopping Center</a>: go shopping there 2 days before Christmas is very very bad idea. Or so I thought.

By now you can probably guess that it was pretty quiet over there, it really was a nice surprise.
