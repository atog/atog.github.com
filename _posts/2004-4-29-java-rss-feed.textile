I finally got around to it, here's my one and only <a href="http://atog.be/java.xml">Java RSS feed</a>.

Especially for <a href="http://javablogs.com">javablogs.com</a> :)

<strong>update:</strong> I'm very sorry, but it's changed already... <a href="http://atog.be/wordpress/wp-rss2.php?cat=4">new Java RSS feed</a>
