title: P6Spy and Spring.
---
I had some problems integrating <a href="http://www.p6spy.com/">P6Spy</a> in our application following the docs.  <a href="http://www.p6spy.com/documentation/index.htm">The docs</a>,  which btw make it look pretty easy but they don't say much about datasources...

Thankfully I stumbled upon <a href="http://templth.blogspot.com/2004/11/integrate-p6spy-with-spring.html">this post: Integrate P6Spy with Spring</a>.  Mucho easier, yes yes. I tweaked it a bit though,  like using <code>P6ConnectionPoolDataSource</code> and the normal (provided with the distribution) <code>spy.properties</code> instead of <a href="http://templth.blogspot.com/2004/11/integrate-p6spy-with-spring.html">the described <code>sp6spy.log</code> file</a>.

So using P6Spy with <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a> is actually a lot easier then the easy way it's supposed to be (wow, does that sentence makes sense? ;)) You actually don't need to know anything about specific P6Spy configuration details.

Now let's take a look at the output...

As you can see, piece of cake. ;)
