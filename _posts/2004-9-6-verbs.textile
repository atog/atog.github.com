After <em>googling</em>, as in <em>someone who's using <a href="http://google.com">Google</a></em>, I just found a new one:

<em>ebaying</em>, as in <em>someone who's selling something on <a href="http://ebay.com">ebay</a></em> :)

It's possible people have been using it for some time now, but it's the first time <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/03/father_ted_prop_on_e.html">I read it</a>.
