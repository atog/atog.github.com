pfff...damn, our television gave up on us last week :( it's only two years old. now today we called a repair-service and you know what? the guy says the microprocessor is broken. ok? how would i know?!?

so in the end we have to pay the broken piece + working hours + transportation costs = 250 euros! apparantely the microprocessor is the core of the tv or something like that...

i think i'm going to repair tv's :p
