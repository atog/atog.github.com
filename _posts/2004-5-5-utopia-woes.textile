title: Utopia woes
---
Ever played <a href="http://games.swirve.com/utopia">Utopia</a>? Well, if you haven't I suggest you <a href="http://games.swirve.com/utopia">check it out</a>.  Otherwise you know what I'm talking about, and you probably know it's a really fun game to play.

Now about the <em>woes</em>: I have been mehulled (as in deleted)! Why? I don't know, I wasn't cheating, I didn't have any multiple accounts, nothing like. The only thing I do know is that was in the top 50 of the world.

Here's my last cb, for those who are interested.
