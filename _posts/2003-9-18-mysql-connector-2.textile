title: mysql connector (2)

apparentely it didn't fix the problem after all...

first thing i did was set "autoReconnect=true" in the connection url. this didn't solve the problem either.
so i downloaded another version of the connector (<a href='http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-old.html'>Connector/J 2.0</a>) and...

so far so good, for now it seems to be working :)
