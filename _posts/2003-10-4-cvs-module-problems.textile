title: cvs module problems
---
today i wanted to install cvs (on winxp) so i downloaded the latest version from <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">http://www.cvshome.org</a>, i created a repository, added my source and modified the modules-file.

i think this version of cvs didn't me like cause time after time (when i tried to checkout my source) it failed to open the modules-file :(

<blockquote><b>cvs [checkout aborted]: failed to open the modules file</b></blockquote>

so after a while, i almost gave up, i decided to give <a href="http://www.wincvs.org/index.html">wincvs</a> a try. i installed it and guess what,  the cvs which comes with wincvs did exactly what it was supposed to do: display my modules! :p

<blockquote><b>CVSROOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVSROOT<br />
       modules&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVSROOT modules<br />
       src&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src</b></blockquote>

now i would like to know why the cvshome version (1.11.5) doesn't work, but in the mean time i use the executable of wincvs.
