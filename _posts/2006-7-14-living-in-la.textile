Quote:
bq.  Residents should take the following precautions to minimize their risk to becoming a victim:
*    Avoid walking alone at night and in unpopulated or poorly lit areas
*   Always be aware of your surroundings
*    Look confident and purposeful when walking
*    If threatened, scream, cross the street and run in the opposite direction, toward other people
*    Keep doors and windows locked in your car and your home
*    Be a good witness when a crime happens and report it to police


Voor de rest is alles ok ginder zenne...geniet maar van het goe weer.
