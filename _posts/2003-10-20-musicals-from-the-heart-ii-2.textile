the <a href="http://www.zuiderkroon.be/programma/mfth2.html">musical</a> i saw on friday was actually pretty good. the artists did a good job, especially the dancers. nice, really nice. they brought a number of songs from Grease, Moulin Rouge, Evita, Chicago, ...

i don't think i would go see something like that again :p but for this one time, it was a success.
