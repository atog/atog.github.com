My life's been pretty busy lately... mm, maybe that's an understatement ;)

Last week we saw <a href="http://clouseau.be/">Clouseau</a>, if you never heard of these guys, don't worry, it's a famous <em>Belgian</em> band. As a matter of fact, I thought they were pretty good. Not to go really wild, but good.  At least now I know all their songs by heart. :P

Furthermore we had a deadline at work, so you know how that goes...

And this week I'm attending <a href="http://wiki.javapolis.com">Javapolis</a>, expect more on that soon. It's the first time I go a Java event, so for me it's really a wonderfull first-time experience! 1400 people registered, all Java, 5 days, I now can put a face on all those speakers.  Fun all over the place. :D
