title: Happy Birthday!
---
Today's my wifes' birthday, so we had a <em>'little'</em> party last night :)

First we had diner in @ <a href="http://www.resto.be/ware/details.jsp?businessid=1370">Via Via</a>. Food was good, service was good and company was excellent!! Maybe one could say that the entrees were a bit expensive but we had a great start of the evening.

Afterwards we tried to find a good place to have a drink in Antwerp, which was not that obvious considering the weather (too hot) and the fact that it was a Saturday. We had planned to go to <a href="http://www.denegenvaten.be/">De negen vaten</a> but by the time we got there (23hrs) the place was full. We ended up in <a href="http://www.sengers.ch/usland/karbonkel/">Karbonkel</a>.

Next we went to <a href="http://www.biazaar.be/">Biazaar</a>. Man! Did we have a great time! We were only 10 years older then the average age over there but it was terrific! Great music, all retro ;) 

It felt like I could do that every night of the week!
